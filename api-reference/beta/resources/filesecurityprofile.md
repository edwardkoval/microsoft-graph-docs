# fileSecurityProfile resource type

 > **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Defines the relevant security properties of files to provide additional context for alerts and targets for actions.

Security profiles are populated by integrated solutions at their discretion. For example:

- A solution will populate hostSecurityProfile for any desktop, laptop, server, firewall, or other endpoint that their service is responsible for monitoring, alerting, or taking threat remediation actions against.
- A provider will populate **ipSecurityProfile** for a collected set of IP addresses that their service is responsible for isolating, monitoring, or configuring.
